## Setup
To install the application locally follow these steps:
* Setup and install an Apache and PHP server
  * Simple to do by downloading and installing [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)
* Clone the GitHub repo into your webserver root folder
  * If installed MAMP it will be the `MAMP/htdocs` folder
* Can now go to `localhost/q-managment` in a web browser and should get the main index page
